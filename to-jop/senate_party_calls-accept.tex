\cite{Minozzi:2013} advance the idea that a substantial portion of partisan
voting activity in Congress is a simple call to unity that is especially easily
embraced by ideological extremists.
If correct, their findings should extend from the House to the Senate, despite
differences in institutional structures and in tools at the disposal of party
leaders across the two chambers.
We adapt the theory and measurement of party calls to the Senate.
In so doing, we find that both the House and the Senate have relied heavily
(and increasingly) on party calls over the past four decades.
In the Senate in particular, the lens of party calls opens new opportunities
for scholars to explore partisan legislative behavior.
We take advantage of one such opportunity to show how electoral concerns limit
Senators' responsiveness to party calls, depriving party leaders of support for
their agenda items.

\invisiblesection{Introduction}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\noindent When scholars think of partisan influence in legislative voting they
often conceive of pressure exerted on fence-sitting legislators to win them over
to the party leaders' preferred position.
Given such a conception, party leaders in the Senate are thought to be less
influential than their House counterparts because they possess fewer tools and
opportunities to exert pressure.\footnote{
  \doublespacing\normalsize
  Yet, recent work has shown significant party effects in the Senate
  \citep[e.g.,][]{Gailmard:2007, Monroe:2008, Patty:2008, Volden:2006}.}
In contrast to a pressure-based approach to understanding parties,
\cite{Minozzi:2013} offer a theory of party calls.
They suggest that, on many issues, unity among party members serves broad
partisan ends, such as brand development \citep[e.g.,][]{Snyder:2002}, apart
from attempts to win closely contested votes on legislation.
As a result, leaders' attempts to call party members to vote together will be
more influential on extremists (who benefit from a coherent brand) than on
cross-pressured moderates.
Minozzi and Volden (MV) identify party-call votes and find enhanced
responsiveness to them among extremists in the U.S. House.

We envision a ``party call'' vote as occurring when the party leadership
identifies a position of value to the party as a whole, broadcasts that position
to party members, and asks---with no threat of punishment nor promise of
reward---for their support, in the best interests of the party.
Whereas many other partisan tools and institutional structures (e.g., agenda
setting powers, committee assignment procedures, election timing, germaneness
or cloture rules) differ across chambers in ways that may affect the strength of
party leaders, we argue that the ability to issue and receive party calls is
largely similar between the House and Senate.\footnote{
  \doublespacing\normalsize
  Numerous scholars \citep[e.g.,][]{DenHartog:2011, Madonna:2011,
  Sinclair:2017, Smith:2007} wrestle with these cross-chamber differences in
  partisanship and lawmaker behavior.}
We adapt MV's approach to the Senate and find strong evidence that party
calls unite members, especially inducing ideological extremists to vote with
their party, above and beyond their natural tendencies.

In addition to extending the examination of party calls to the Senate, we
expand the time period of examination from MV to include the 93$^{\text{rd}}$
through the 112$^{\text{th}}$ Congresses (1973-2012) for both the House and the
Senate.
Consistent with other evidence of partisan polarization across this era, we see
a steady rise in the use of party calls over time across both chambers and
regardless of Democrat or Republican control.
Finally, we argue that extending the study of party calls to the Senate opens
numerous opportunities for important new scholarship.
Illustrating one such possibility, we show that Senators up for reelection are
significantly less responsive to party calls, consistent with bucking the party
when it is out of line with voters in their home states.

Party Calls in the Senate}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%


To explore party calls, MV use a two-step process, first dividing floor votes
into ``party-free votes'' and ``party calls,'' and then examining which
legislators are most responsive to party calls beyond their baseline partisan
support on party-free votes.
Identifying party calls is a difficult classification problem requiring
researchers to identify a strong party-based voting pattern apart from that
produced by ideological differences alone.
We mimic the approach in MV that produces the list of party-call votes and
simultaneously generates party-free ideal points for each legislator.\footnote{
  \doublespacing\normalsize
  Minor modifications were made to adapt this method to the Senate and to
  reduce computational burdens (see Supplemental Appendix A).}

The party calls identified through this process broadly reflect properties
expected of partisan votes (see Supplemental Appendix A for details).
For example, party calls tend to drive a further wedge between Democrats and
Republicans beyond their initial ideological separation.
Moreover, party calls are more likely on close votes than lopsided votes,
perhaps because the close votes offer greater opportunity for parties to
differentiate themselves.
In total, these patterns lend confidence that our classification of party-call
votes is meaningful in capturing broad and consistent underlying behavior.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics{party-calls-over-time}
\caption{
  Party calls as a percentage of all votes, 1973--2012.
  This figure shows the percentage of votes classified as party calls per
  Congress in each chamber.
  Circles denote Democrat-majority chambers while triangles denote
  Republican-majority chambers.
  \label{fig-party-calls-over-time}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-party-calls-over-time} illustrates that the percentage of party
calls among all votes in the House and Senate has been steadily increasing over
time.\footnote{
  \doublespacing\normalsize
  Differences across chambers based on membership size render
  direct House-Senate comparisons in the proportion of party-call votes
  inappropriate.}
It is possible that parties are calling more because partisan ideological
alignment has made party calls more effective, or because parties need members
to rally more to get their agendas through a heavily gridlocked Congress.
The underlying cause of this trend merits further investigation.
The pattern is consistent with the much discussed increased partisanship and
polarization in recent decades \citep[e.g.,][]{Aldrich:2000, Lee:2009, Lee:2016,
Theriault:2013, Smith:2014}, and holds regardless of which party is in the
majority.

The fundamental idea of the theory of party calls is that, rather than solely
winning close votes, much partisan activity in Congress works to align members
who might otherwise wander away from the party for idiosyncratic reasons.
As such, those most responsive to party calls are extremists, whose preferences
deviate the most from the opposing party---not cross-pressured, fence-sitting
moderates.
To test this ``Responsive Extremists Hypothesis,'' we estimate linear models of
\textit{Responsiveness} to party calls, measuring each legislator's percentage
support for the party position on party-call votes.
Throughout, we cluster observations by legislator and Congress to account for
possible dependence.
Table~\ref{tab-responsiveness-regressions} shows support for the Responsive
Extremists Hypothesis holds in the extended period over which we examine the
House and also in the Senate.

We include the control variables from MV, notably accounting for the
\textit{Baseline Rate} of voting with the party on party-free votes.\footnote{
  \doublespacing\normalsize
  See Supplemental Appendix B for descriptions and summary statistics for all
  variables.}
Although some House-Senate differences emerge, such as for Southerners or those
on power committees, the broad patterns are consistent across
institutions.\footnote{
  \doublespacing\normalsize
  Given the small size of the Senate, most members are on one of the top
  committees, limiting the variance that allowed patterns based on committee
  assignments to be discerned in the House.}
For example, positive coefficients indicate that \textit{Party Leaders} and
\textit{Committee Chairs} are more responsive to party calls, all else equal.

As shown by the coefficients on \textit{Ideological Extremism} and in strong
support of the theory of party calls, each one-standard-deviation increase in
that variable is associated with a nearly eight percentage point increase in
\textit{Responsiveness} in the House, and more than six points in the
Senate.\footnote{
  \doublespacing\normalsize
  The effect sizes are similar to those uncovered by MV in the House between
  1973 and 2006.}
This party alignment extends above and beyond the baseline support on
party-free votes.

The pattern of ideological extremists being more responsive to party calls than
moderates holds for both Democrats and Republicans, and for majority party and
minority party members (see Supplemental Appendix C).
This robust support is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-extremism-responsiveness}
based on separate regressions for each party in each Congress, which is a tough
test of the Responsive Extremists Hypothesis, especially given the small
membership of the Senate.
In the House, \textit{Ideological Extremism} takes a positive coefficient for
all but four cases, and in the Senate for all but two.
Further, in the House, all positive coefficients are statistically significant;
in the Senate, 29 of the 38 positive coefficients are statistically significant,
while only one negative coefficient is.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics{extremism-responsiveness}
\caption{
  Extremists are responsive to party calls in both chambers.
  This coefficient plot is produced by the same formula shown in
  Table~\ref{tab-responsiveness-regressions} with results decomposed for the
  majority and minority parties in each of the
  93$^{\text{rd}}$-112$^{\text{th}}$ Congresses (1973-2012).
  Circles denote Democrats, and triangles Republicans.
  Both indicate coefficient estimates for \textit{Ideological Extremism} in
  regressions of \textit{Responsiveness} to party calls, with 50\% and 95\%
  confidence intervals.
  \label{fig-extremism-responsiveness}}
\end{figure}

These findings paint a coherent portrait of party calls in both chambers of the
U.S. Congress.
Party-call votes are widespread, have increased over the past four decades, and
divide Democrats from Republicans.
And, contrary to alternative views of party pressure, these votes draw
\textit{ideologically extreme} members---rather than moderates---toward the
unified partisan position.

Beyond uncovering such a systematic and important partisan process in Congress,
the party calls identified here offer the potential to significantly enhance
scholarly exploration of parties in the Senate.
New research based on party calls could contribute to a fuller understanding of
partisan practices and norms spreading from the House to the Senate
\citep[e.g.,][]{Theriault:2013}, of the role of partisanship in advancing and
overcoming filibusters \citep[e.g.,][]{Wawro:2013}, and of electoral
constraints on partisan behavior \citep[e.g.,][]{Levitt:1996}, to name a few
opportunities.

To illustrate the usefulness of party calls, we tackle the last of these
possibilities.
As an initial test, the model in the final column of
Table~\ref{tab-responsiveness-regressions} includes an indicator variable for
whether a Senator is in her final Congress before reelection.
Based on the theory of party calls, we expect Senators to be more free to help
develop a party brand---even in contrast to their constituents'
preferences---just after elections rather than when the next election is
imminent.
Consistent with this hypothesis, Table~\ref{tab-responsiveness-regressions}
shows about one percentage point lower \textit{Responsiveness} to party calls
among those \textit{Up for Reelection} than among those in their first four
years following an election, all else equal.
In the next section, we explore this result more fully.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{\thesection}
Reelection Limits Responsiveness to Party Calls}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%


We argue that Senators up for reelection will be more attuned to their electoral
needs than to broad party interests.
Put simply, they will use some party-call votes to improve their
personal---rather than party---brand \citep[e.g.,][]{Canes-Wrone:2002,
Carson:2010}.
We detected evidence consistent with such a pattern above; but to better
identify causal effects, we build a design based on same-state Senator pairs in
which one Senator is \textit{Up for Reelection} at the end of the Congress.
In this quasi-experimental design, the treatment group consists of those
Senators who are in their final two years before reelection, and the control
group includes the remaining Senators who are not in their final two years,
and therefore not up for reelection.
These pairings are ideal because same-state Senators are elected by the same
constituents, but not at the same time, allowing us to estimate the effects of
being \textit{Up for Reelection} using a model with fixed effects for each
state-Congress pair.
We further control for all relevant covariates and, to improve precision in our
causal estimates, adjust for lagged \textit{Ideological Extremism},
\textit{Responsiveness}, and \textit{Baseline Rate}.
Similar results hold without these control variables (see Supplemental Appendix
D).

Based on the logic above, we expect that the Senator who is
\textit{Up for Reelection} will have lower \textit{Responsiveness} to party
calls than her same-state Senate partner.
In contrast, we expect no difference between the \textit{Baseline Rate} of
voting with the party on party-free votes.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 12cm]{senate_difference_estimates}
\caption{
  Senators up for reelection are less responsive to party calls, yet there is
  no evidence that reelection affects \textit{Baseline Rate} of voting with the
  party.
  This figure summarizes fixed effects models of same-state Senator pairs in
  which one is \textit{Up for Reelection}.
  Estimates are differences in \textit{Responsiveness} to party calls and the
  \textit{Baseline Rate} of voting with the party, with 50\% and 95\%
  confidence intervals based on clustered standard errors.
\label{fig-reelection-responsiveness}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-reelection-responsiveness} shows that \textit{Responsiveness}
to party calls declines an average of about 1.3\% when a Senator is
\textit{Up for Reelection}.
However, the \textit{Baseline Rate} of voting with the party is unchanged by
electoral considerations, an anticipated null finding that bolsters our
confidence in the validity of this research design.\footnote{
  \doublespacing\normalsize
  In an alternative approach, we compared all three possibilities for
  same-state Senator pairs based on proximity to upcoming election.
  Comparing those \textit{Up for Reelection} to those in the first Congress
  after election shows a similar effect to that in
  Figure~\ref{fig-reelection-responsiveness}.
  Likewise, comparing those \textit{Up for Reelection} to those in the middle
  two years of their six-year term reveals lower \textit{Responsiveness} for
  those \textit{Up for Reelection}.
  In contrast, comparing same-state Senators neither of whom are
  \textit{Up for Reelection}, we find no difference in \textit{Responsiveness},
  treating the more senior Senator as the one closer to election.
  Across all three cases, we find no differences in their
  \textit{Baseline Rate}.}
During the period of analysis, the average \textit{Responsiveness} to party
calls is 85\%.
Across the 365 party-call votes in the average Senate, a Senator not
\textit{Up for Reelection} therefore averages 53 defections from her party.
In contrast, those \textit{Up for Reelection} defect from party calls 58 times
on average, almost a ten percent increase.
Such deviations may limit the party's effectiveness in both lawmaking and brand
development.
But they offer the election-seeking Senator an opportunity to build her support
and reputation back home.

Conclusion}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

In this short paper, we established that legislators respond to party calls in
the Senate as they do in the House.
In both chambers, party calls have become more prominent over the past forty
years.
In line with expectations, when leaders issue party calls, legislators
align with their party, with the greatest effect being among ideological
extremists.

One especially noteworthy finding is the nature of the relationship we uncover
between party and ideology.
In contrast to \citeapos{Krehbiel:1993} view that partisanship is often merely
a reflection of ideology, or \citeapos{Lee:2009} view that party extends well
beyond ideology, we find party and ideology to be largely complementary yet
distinct.
When the party calls its members together, those who most wish to distinguish
themselves from the opposing party---typically ideological extremists---respond
most vigorously to the call.

We further showed the value of party calls as a tool for studying legislative
behavior.
We found that reelection reduced member responsiveness to party calls.
Under electoral threat, constituent preferences are front and center in
Senators' minds, and thus we hypothesized---and found---that members up for
reelection are less responsive to the party.
This finding shows one of the limits to leaders' party-building efforts
inherent in party calls.
